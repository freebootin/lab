# Slackware Experience and Tips

This will be a record of my experience with Slackware Linux.

## Why Slackware?

I have been exerimenting with FreeBSD for the past week and I really like the core utilities and the documentation. However, the Bhyve virtualization software wasn't really what I wanted as far as emulation, and my next choice, qemu, is not will supported on the BSD's.  This is a deal breaker from me. 

I am looking at Slackware because it *seems* to be the most BSD like Linux distro with a decent sized community.
